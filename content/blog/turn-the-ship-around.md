### When Leader-Follower Model Breaks

Leader-follower model divides the world into two groups of people

You can accomplish a lot with this model, given adept leaders: industrial revolution, pyramids.

But this model is optimized for extracting _physical work_ from people.

Nowadays, the work we do is cognitive, and this model kind of breaks down. Followers are expected to be followers, and are given little room for decision-making, and therefore are not incentivized to give their utmost intellect, energy, and passion.

This is well-known, and so we solve it with "empowerment."

> The problem with empowerment programs is that they contain an inherent contradiction between the message and the method. While the message is "empowerment," the method -- it takes me to empower you -- fundamentally disempowers employees.

> When the performance of a unit goes down after an officer leaves, it is taken as a sign he was a good leader, not that he was ineffective in training his people properly

> People who are treated as followers treat others as followers when it is their turn to lead.


### The What/How Line

Real empowerment can be acheived in a few ways, one of which is acknowledging, what I call, the _What/How Line_.

The What/How Line is drawn to ensure those specifying the _what_, don't also get to specify the _how_. And similarly, those determining the _how_, aren't burdened with also considering the _what_.

This is not an original idea. It's the basis on which the relationship between a product manager, and a senior developer is encouraged by .....

In that specific scenario, the product manager and the senior engineer are peers. But this same line can be successfully used in relationships between superiors and subordinates. Superiors can specify to subordinates _what_ they want, or expect (e.g.: a specific _goal_), but they should respect the Line by not specifying _how_ to deliver upon those expectations.

Simple, but not necessarily easy. This approach forces people into the potentially unfamiliar, and uncomfortable situation in which they must apply their intellect, energy, and passion. It gives them freedom to try new things. The superior might also be uncomfortable watching the suborniate execute using an approach they themselves would not have used, thinking _it won't work_.

This approach places risk on both sides of the line:

*   The specifier of the _what_ needs to trust, with their professional reputation, that the executor of the _how_ will deliver.
*   The executor of the _how_ is given a chance, with their professional reputation, to deliver the _what_ without the saftey net of "I was just doing what I was told".

But as a leader, this can work really well because it frees you from having to know how. It's a fantastic framework for delegation. **TODO** bottlenecking, etc, status reports on progress towards goals, not approval/permission for decisions.

And you can get closer to real empowerment without disrupting traditional organizational structures (i.e.: hierarchy). The people who know how, and like to know how, get to do the how. The people who know what, and like to know the what, get to specify the what.

This approach leads to situations in which leaders actually seek out people technically smarter, or at least more techincally informed than them. Additionally this approach ensures technical competence isn't confused for leadership, so, for example, we will be less inclined to promote our best engineers into management roles,

### The Leader-Leader Model

### Push Decisions to the Lowest Level Possible

> Resist the urge to provide solutions
> Use "I intend to ..." to turn passive followers into active leaders
> Being a chief would no longer mean a position of privilege, but a position of accountability, responsibility, and work.
> Many empowerment programs fail because they are just that, "programs" or "initiatives" rather than the central principle ... You can't direct empowerment programs. Directed empowerment programs are flawed because they are predicated on this assumption: I have the authority and ability to empower you, and you don't. Fundamentally, that's disempowering.
