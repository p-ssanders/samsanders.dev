<h1>Build vs Buy</h1>

  <p>I have a bias to buy rather than build. I have this bias primarily because when buying is even an option I can then infer that there&rsquo;s a market for that product.</p>

<p>So I have to ask:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is my core business competing in that market?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the answer is &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that is, if my core business isn&rsquo;t in the market of products like the one being considered for build, then building is hard to justify.</p>

<p>DIYing products that aren&rsquo;t part of the core business costs time, money, people, and never stops costing until it&rsquo;s no longer in production. Just like any other product, a DIY product will need patches, new features, and it will have technical debt. And none of it generates revenue. In fact, it generates expense and distraction from market opportunities.</p>

<p>Take for example, Cloud Platforms.</p>

<p>The company I work for, <a href="https://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>, or rather their flagship product, <a href="https://pivotal.io/platform">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>, is often the object of this type of &ldquo;<em>Build vs Buy</em>&rdquo; discussion.</p>

<p>Before Pivotal, I worked at a place that decided to build their own cloud platform. I think they were biased toward build, however, because they DIY&rsquo;d a lot, and had a suite of tools and services that didn&rsquo;t directly generate revenue. At the time I had no idea how to build a cloud platform. I knew what <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> was, and it definitely did not seem trivial, or even realistic to try to build. It pained me to consider building something like that.</p>

<p>Recently, I took this table of what are essentially responsibilities and capabilities that a platform should have and should provide from a Pivotal white paper called <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/the-upside-down-economics-of-building-your-own-platform">The Upside Down Economics of Building Your Own Platform</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Wow.</strong></p>

<p>But there are companies, like Pivotal in this example, that have built a product that can bear those responsibilities, and provide those capabilities. Today. Now.</p>

<p>This is just one example, too. I can probably do the same analysis for any market in which there are mature products already offered by vendors.</p>

<p>So how do you justify committing the time, the energy, and the people to building something that even comes close to mature, vendor products when your primary business is something other than that?</p>
