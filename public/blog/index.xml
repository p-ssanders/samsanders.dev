      <title>Build vs Buy</title>

      <description>I have a bias to buy rather than build. I have this bias primarily because when buying is even an option, then you can infer that there&amp;rsquo;s a market for that product.
So you have to ask:
 &amp;ldquo;Is my core business competing in that market?&amp;rdquo;
 If the answer is &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; that is, if your core business isn&amp;rsquo;t in the market of building products like the one you&amp;rsquo;re considering building, then the decision to build is hard to justify.</description>

      <title>How I Made This</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a website for myself, and to have a place where I could write things. Writing things that are available to the public internet is scary, but I figured it would help keep me honest. I also wanted to learn a new way to make a website. Now that I have one, I can write how I made it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi, this is my first blog post.
First blog posts can be really meaningful, or they can be a throwaway.
This is probably a throwaway.</description>
